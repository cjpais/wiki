# Weekly Brain Dump

## What is this?

I take a lot of quick notes and have a lot of half baked ideas from them. This is a space for me to expand on any thoughts from the week that I thought were notable. **The ideas will still not be fully formed.** This will be a representation of my thought development process. There will be reoccuring themes and the themes will become more clear over time.
