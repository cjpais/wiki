# Binge watching TV shows

Just was thinking about this a little while watching Westworld. If you binge watch you do get engrossed in the show, but afterwards you may forget a lot of it relatively quickly. There's not much more there to keep in your brain. Or a reason to keep it in your brain. I noticed this with Lost to some degree. Seems like the 'spaced repetition' of a weekly show is better. The recap is helpful because you're like oh yea! Maybe gives a show some more staying power. I guess with Westworld, to me it already is a classic. They've done a fantastic job
