## I don't know!

Does anyone know?!

### **Should be give people the day off to vote if so?**

### **Even this isn't enough right?**

### **What about emergencies?**

**Ya, theres vote by mail, and I voted by mail, but what the hell? Not everyone is voting by mail!**

### **What if its just a bad day?**
