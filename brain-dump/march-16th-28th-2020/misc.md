### How would you design a city from the ground up?

No idea. **Would want plenty of space to bike around tho.** I would want to live in a coastal city close to the mountains probs. lol this is SD/LA. This came from conversation with Jon, not sure how to organize on this. Again event stream hopefully will help take care of cleaning and organizing these ideas. Can clearly get the origin of the thought and the context of it \(manually initially\)

Probably develop this more later

solarpunk city for sure would be interesting
