# March 30th-April 5th 2020

Looks like I spent too much time on the project this weekend ðŸ˜Š Will quickly write some notes about it.

Also thinking about doing this in a slightly different way for next week. 

* Write down what I am thinking in the app
* Review and write on it the next day at 8:00AM if anything of note
* Sunday, review the writings and publish
